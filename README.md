# Introduction

Project goal is to simplify the usage of the CQRS Pattern under backbone.js by 
providing needed infrastructure.

### Samples

- [sample folder](https://github.com/jamuhl/backbone.CQRS/tree/master/sample) A pure static sample
- [nodeCQRS](https://github.com/jamuhl/nodeCQRS) Sample implementation using socket.io

# Usage

To use CQRS on the clientside and inside Backbone.js we will need to push _events_ 
to the browser. You can achieve this via websockets, flash, long polling or any 
other technique around.

## INITIALIZATION

To configure Backbone.CQRS you got to init the `Backbone.CQRS.hub`.

	// given your events look something like this
	var event = {
		name: 'personChanged', // the unique name of this event
		payload: {
			id: 'someId', // the provided id should match the Backbone.Model.Id
			anotherValue: 'something'
		}	
	};

	// you can go with defaults
	Backbone.CQRS.hub.init();
	
	// override Backbone.sync with CQRS.sync which allows only GET method
	Backbone.sync = Backbone.CQRS.sync;

There are a few options you can pass in on init. You find more information [here](http://jamuhl.github.com/backbone.CQRS/#init_options).


### Wire up commands and events to/from sever

The interface to Backbone.CQRS is provided through `Backbone.CQRS.hub`:

	// pass in events from your socket
	mySocket.on('events', function(data){
		Backbone.CQRS.hub.emit('events', data);
	});

	// pass commands to socket
	Backbone.CQRS.hub.on('commands', function(data) {
		mySocket.emit('commands', data);
	});

## EVENT HANDLING

### Denormalize event data

First create a denormalizer:

    // personChange event
    var personCreatedHandler = new Backbone.CQRS.EventDenormalizer({
        forModel: 'person',
        forEvent: 'personChanged'
    });

    var person = Backbone.Model.extend({modelName: 'person'});

    var me = new person({id: '1'});
    me.bindCQRS();

all _personChanged_ events payload attributes for id = 1 will be applied to the personModel by simply 
set the event data to the model.

For events that _create_ or _delete_ a model you can create your denormalizer like this:

    // personCreated event
    var personCreatedHandler = new Backbone.CQRS.EventDenormalizer({
        methode: 'create',     // change methode to create
        model: Person,         // pass in model you want create with eventdata
        collection: persons,   // pass in collection or function returning collection you want to add to

        // bindings
        forModel: 'person',
        forEvent: 'personCreated'
    });

    // personDeleted event
    var personDeletedHandler = new Backbone.CQRS.EventDenormalizer({
        methode: 'delete', // change methode to delete (will call unbindCQRS and destroy on model)

        // bindings
        forModel: 'person',
        forEvent: 'personDeleted'
    });

For advanced options for denormalizing look [here](http://jamuhl.github.com/backbone.CQRS/#adv_evt_denorm).


## COMMAND HANDLING

### send commands

To send commands just:

    var cmd = new Backbone.CQRS.Command({
        name: 'changePerson',
        payload: {
            id: 8,
            name: 'my name'
        }
    });

    // emit it
    cmd.emit();

You can react on an event responding to a command. Find more information [here](http://jamuhl.github.com/backbone.CQRS/#adv_cmd_observ).
